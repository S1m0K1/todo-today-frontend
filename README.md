# Todo Application - Frontend 

This is the front end of a To-do Application, built through the [Tech Returners](https://www.techreturners.com/) Your Journey Into Tech course, and BBC Step into Tech.
<br /> 

A simple, visually compelling, usable to-do app: designed with simplicity in mind and as easy to use as a piece of paper. Type to-dos where you want them, move them around, then click to mark them  done.
<br />

Hurrah for getting things done!

It integrates with a backend, available [here](https://github.com/S1m0K1/todo-today-backend)<br />
